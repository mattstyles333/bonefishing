  content: 'Unspoiled and undiscovered - the flats of Bottle Creek offer world-class
    bonefishing. We don''t have to run far, so we pass those savings on to you. There
    is expense if coming from Provo; the round-trip ferry ride is $55 - but once you
    land at Sandy Point North Caicos, we meet and transport you to the lodge for the
    start of the days fishing and transport you back to the dock for your return trip.<br><br> '

  headline: "<strong>Location and coming from Providenciales</strong>"
  content: A 30 minute ferry ride ($55 return) from Leeward on Providenciales to Sandy
    Point on North Caicos opens up the chance to fish on flats that have only been
    fished by a few anglers before. Several flats are great wading - shallow and firm
    - ideal for stalking tailing fish..............others are wide and sandy so that
    you can see schools of bonefish meandering across from a distance away.

  headline: "<strong>Rates/Lodge</strong>"
  content: Our bonefishing rates for fishing and flyfishing in the Turks and Caicos
    are some of the least expensive to be found. We offer a range of options from
    self-guided flyfishing to guided on the flats and creeks of the islands contiguous
    to Providenciales. The rate for a full day is $700 (inc. 12% tax) for up to two
    anglers/guests.<br>If you are interested in DIY - we offer accommodation on the
    shore of the flats with full use of kayaks so that you can choose where and when
    to fish at your leisure
